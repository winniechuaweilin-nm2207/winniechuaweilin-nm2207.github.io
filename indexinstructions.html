            Objective: Locate 50 randomly-placed "bombs" in the shortest possible time.<br><br>
            Players are to identify "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with bombs. If the player clicks on a bomb, the game ends. Otherwise, a number between 0 and 8 is displayed, which identifies the total number of bombs present in the eight neighboring squares. A square suspected of containing a bomb may be marked in orange by a right-click. Player wins the game if all the squares with bombs are marked in orange.<br><br>
