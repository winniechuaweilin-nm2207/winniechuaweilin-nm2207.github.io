    <h1>Hello! Here's the draft for my Final Project</h1>
    <p>Would definitely appreciate if you could provide me with some feedback :-)</p>
    <p>I would like to challenge myself and create a game for my Final Project! The game that I have in mind has 2 modes: Survival and Adventure.<br>
        <br>
        <h2>Survival Mode</h2>
        Objective: Avoid getting caught by the npc (wolf) for as long as possible
        <br>
        <br>
        How to play:
        There will be 3 running lanes. Player is to avoid the obstacles by jumping (not sure if this is possible) or switching lanes. The frequency and speed of obstacles be faster and faster as time passes. If player were to touch the obstacle, player would take 2 seconds to recover before being able to continue with the game. When the npc catches up with player (player touches obstacle twice), the game ends. The duration in which player manages to survive from the npc is the “score”.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Adventure Mode</h2>
        Objective: Collect as many coins as possible and avoid getting caught by the npc (wolf) before reaching the safe zone.
        <br><br>
        There will be 3 stages in adventure mode.
        <br>
        <br>
        Storyline: Player (red riding hood) got lost in the forest and was chased by the big bad wolf. Help red riding hood escape from the wolf.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Stage 1:</h3>There will be a 30 seconds count down for player to reach the safe zone. Players are to avoid obstacles while collecting as many coins as possible. For every obstacle player touches, 2 seconds will be deducted from the countdown timer. If player is unable to reach the safe zone in 30 seconds, npc “catches up” to player and player loses. Player will only be able to unlock stage 2 if they reach the safe zone within time limit.
        <br><br>
        *3 stars - coins >= 20<br>
          2 stars - 15-19 coins<br>
          1 star - coins < 15
        <br>
        <br>
        Storyline: npc (wolf) starts to destroy the safe zone (house) and player has no choice but to leave and search for another safe zone (house)
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Stage 2:</h3> There will be a 20 seconds count down to reach the next safe zone. Similar to stage 1, player is to avoid obstacles while collecting as much coins as possible. For stage 2, obstacles will be approaching faster and more frequently. If player is unable to reach the safe zone in 20 seconds, npc “catches up” to player and player loses. Player will only be able to unlock stage 3 if they reach the safe zone within time limit.
        <br><br>
        *3 stars - coins >= 15<br>
          2 stars - 10-14 coins<br>
          1 star - coins < 10
        <br>
        <br>
        Storyline: npc (wolf) once again destroys the safe zone (house) and player has no choice but to leave and search for another safe place
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Stage 3:</h3>There will be a 10 seconds count down to reach the “finishing line” (outskirts of forest). The game objective remains the same. For stage 3, obstacles will be approaching even faster and more frequently. If player is unable to reach the “finishing line” (outskirts of forest) in 10 seconds, npc “catches up” to player and player loses.
        <br><br>
        *3 stars - coins >= 9<br>
          2 stars - 7-8 coins<br>
          1 star - coins < 6
        <br>
        <br>
        Storyline: Red riding hood escaped from the big bad wolf, thank you for saving her life!
