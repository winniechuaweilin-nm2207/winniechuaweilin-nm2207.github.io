            <h3>Leisure Mode: How to Play?</h3>
            Objective: Locate 50 randomly-placed "bombs" in the shortest possible time.<br><br>
            1. Players are to identify "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with bombs.<br>
            2. If the player clicks on a bomb, the game ends. Otherwise, a number between 0 and 8 is displayed, which identifies the total number of bombs present in the eight neighboring squares.<br>
            3. A square suspected of containing a bomb may be marked with a "danger sign" by a right-click. Player can undo the "danger sign" by right-clicking the same square again. <br>
            4. Player wins the game if all the squares with bombs are marked with a "danger sign".<br><br>
